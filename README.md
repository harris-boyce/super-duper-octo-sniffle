# super-duper-octo-sniffle

## Development Environment

This repository includes a preconfigured devcontainer with:
- **TypeScript/Node.js 20** - Development runtime
- **GitHub Copilot** - AI-powered code suggestions
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's AI coding assistant

To use the devcontainer:
1. Open this repository in VS Code
2. Install the "Dev Containers" extension
3. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
4. After the container builds, run `claude login` to authenticate Claude Code

The Claude Code CLI will be available without requiring elevated permissions and can be upgraded by updating the devcontainer feature version.
